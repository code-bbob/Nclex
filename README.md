#NCLEX
<br>
Nclex is a side project that i am working on that is designed to provide a web interface for students to prepare for their NCLEX examinaition in a similar manner as the actual exam.
Nclex provides students with MCQs that progresively become harder if each subsequent questions are answered correctly and gets easier if subsequent questions are answered incorrectly exactly like the real NCLEX examination.
This project aims to help students realize their level and work harder while providing them some incentive points.
